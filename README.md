# Portable Document Format
  
A **document file format** is a text or binary file format for storing documents on a storage media, especially for use by computers.There currently exist a multitude of incompatible document file formats.
 
In 1993, the ITU-T tried to establish a standard for document file formats, known as the Open Document Architecture (ODA) which was supposed to replace all competing document file formats. It is described in ITU-T documents T.411 through T.421, which are equivalent to ISO 8613. It did not succeed.

Page description languages such as PostScript and PDF have become the *de facto* standard for documents that a typical user should only be able to create and read, not edit. In 2001, a series of ISO/IEC standards for PDF began to be published, including the specification for PDF itself, ISO-32000.
 
The default binary file format used by Microsoft Word (.doc) has become widespread *de facto* standard for office documents, but it is a proprietary format and is not always fully supported by other word processors.
 
An ADF document is composed of a hierarchy of nodes. There are two categories of nodes: block andinline. Block nodes define the structural elements of the document such as headings, paragraphs,lists, and alike. Inline nodes contain the document content such as text and images. Some of thesenodes can take marks that define text formatting or embellishment such as centered, bold, italics,and alike.
 
You'll find several kinds of fields in your application forms - check boxes, dates, data entry fields, and attachments. This page provides guidance on attachments. Attachments are documents that are prepared outside the application using whatever editing software you desire (e.g., Microsoft Word), converted to PDF format, and then added or uploaded to your application. We require PDF format to preserve document formatting and a consistent reading experience for reviewers and staff.
 
We have very specific attachment formatting requirements. Failure to follow these requirements may lead to application errors upon submission or withdrawal of your application from funding consideration.

Adherence to font size, type density, line spacing, and text color requirements is necessary to ensure readability and fairness. Although font requirements apply to all attachments, they are most important and most heavily scrutinized in attachments with page limits.
 
No, once you start editing the document, GoogleDrive will create a duplicate Drive Doc with the same name as the document you uploaded. The original file can still be converted using third party services and the GoogleDrive Doc can be downloaded in Open Document format, but there is no way to keep it in Open Document format the entire time.
 
The ODF standard works on most operating systems for desktops, laptops, mobile phones and tablets. The Open Standards Board has selected the ODF 1.2 standard for use across government. The government chose ODF 1.2 because it:
 
Make sure your chosen solution complies with the ODF standard, whether it is proprietary or free open source. When you are buying an application, product or service that uses editable documents, make sure that you:
 
The commercial function might not consider free software, with no service or support contracts, to be a procurement. Normal procurement rules might apply if you need to add extra services or support to the licence.
 
You might prefer office applications if you need access to rich text editing, making charts or adding corporate branding. You can use dedicated software components to integrate these capabilities. For example:
 
Variable data printing involves printing large numbers of documents. To do variable data printing you will need to convert your ODF documents to PPML (Personalised Print Markup Language). PPML is a standard for high performance printing of large volumes of documents.
 
Do not manually change the font type, font colour, background or letter spacing in template or document generation software. You must use styles and headings to prevent assistive technology, search engines and PDF generators losing information.
 
You can use extensions, plugins or add-ons to increase the functions of your chosen office productivity tools. You should be aware of any impact these additions have on how software conforms to the ODF standard. There are 2 classes of conforming documents:
 
Your image or graphic plugins must always use the universal mechanism for inserting a draw area within the document. This will make sure that the content is viewable by any application that conforms with the ODF standard.
 
Problems converting to ODF 1.2 usually occur when you do not map historical product features. You may also lose some functions when you convert from Microsoft Excel to ODF. Microsoft provides a list of the differences between ODF and Excel.
 
This page provides an overview of requirements for senior/key personnel documents. See the full requirements for these documents in the Proposal and Award Policies and Procedures Guide (PAPPG) II.2.D.h.
 
NSF requires a biographical sketch for each individual identified as senior/key personnel. See **PAPPG Chapter II.D.2.h(i)** for complete coverage on the content and formatting requirements for the biographical sketch.
 
This document outlines an individual's education and training, their appointments and positions, and other information that helps NSF assess how well qualified the individual is to conduct the proposed activities.
 
**Note**: Starting May 20, 2024, biographical sketches should no longer include information on synergistic activities. These activities must instead be listed in the new **Synergistic Activities** document.
 
Senior/key personnel are required to certify that the information is current, accurate and complete. This includes, but is not limited to, information related to domestic and foreign appointments and positions. The certification language is included in the SciENcv template.
 
NSF has partnered with the National Institutes of Health to use **SciENcv: Science Experts Network Curriculum Vitae** as the NSF-approved format for use in preparation of the biographical sketch section of an NSF proposal. Adoption of a single, common researcher profile system for federal grants reduces administrative burden for researchers.
 
NSF requires information on all current and pending support for ongoing projects and proposals. This document contains a list of an individual's proposed and active projects and sources of support. It is used by NSF to assess:
 
Senior/key personnel are required to certify that the information is current, accurate and complete. This includes, but is not limited to, information related to current, pending and other support (both foreign and domestic).

This document contains a table of an individual's collaborators, such as their advisors, co-authors and students. NSF requires the use of the **Collaborators and Other Affiliations Excel Template** for identifying this information. NSF uses Collaborators and Other Affiliations information during the merit review process to help manage reviewer selection. To expedite identification of potential reviewers, having a standard, searchable format for this information is essential.
 
By having each principal investigator, co-PI and other senior project personnel individually upload an .xlsx document, and having Research.gov perform all of the conversions, we preserve searchable text in the resulting PDFs to the greatest extent practicable. This will help reduce the burden on NSF program staff who currently must spend time to manipulate files that are non-searchable.
 
In addition to the benefits to the merit review process, it is hoped that this template will provide a compliant and reusable format for PIs to maintain and update their collaborators and other affiliations information for use in subsequent proposal submissions to NSF.
 
Refer to **PAPPG II.D.2.h(iii)** for the full Collaborators and Other Affiliations information requirements. A brief outline of the information you will need to include is provided below.
 
You must use NSF's **Collaborators and Other Affiliations Excel Template** to prepare your information. The template has been developed to be fillable, however, the content and format requirements must not be altered as this will create printing and viewing errors.
 
**Portable Document Format (PDF)** is developed by Adobe and standardized worldwide. This document type is used for presenting documents with text, graphics, clickable links, audio and video files etc.
 
**OFORM** and **DOCXF** are native formats developed by ONLYOFFICE and represent fillable forms. With these extensions, you can store templates instead of creating similar documents from scratch. Besides, there is a free OFORM library with numerous templates for automated document workflow.
 
Functions in cells calculate based on operands and given conditions. This part of XLSX spreadsheets may seem daunting at first. But even with basic knowledge, XLSX files are nearly the most powerful and customizable tool for automating your daily routine. We have some quick tips for spreadsheets on TikTok.
 
**PPTX** is familiar to anyone who works with presentations and slides. This document format allows creating vivid slideshows with text, objects, effects and transitions, animations. PPTX presentations are prepared for school classes, product portfolio, public performance.
 
The above mentioned document formats are the most popular ones. However, there is no all-size-fits-all extension that would be the best for each occasion. Any document file format has own strengths and drawbacks:
